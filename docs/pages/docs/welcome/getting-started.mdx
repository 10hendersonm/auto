import { Label } from '../../../components/label';

Before we do anything we must first install `auto` as a dev dependency.

```bash
yarn add -D auto
```

If you are using `auto` in a non-javascript project, you can install `auto` and all it's official plugins via the [releases](https://github.com/intuit/auto/releases) page. Here you will find a build of `auto` for all major OSes. This build has `node` bundled so you don't need it installed!

> :warning: If you use <Label color="blue">yarn@2</Label> none of the default plugins (`npm` and `released`) are included so you must install them if you want to use them.

## Help

To get detailed help for any command use the `--help` flag.

```bash
auto --help
# or any of auto's command's help
auto shipit --help
```

### Make "Latest Release"

If your project is already published then you need to make sure that your last release is tagged and that it's the `Latest Release` on GitHub.

To tag your last release find that last commit where you bumped the version and run the following commands with your version number.

```bash
git tag v1.2.3
git push --tags
```

Then on GitHub go to your project's releases and click `Draft a new release`.
In the `Tag version` field enter the version number you just tagged and click `Publish release`.

Now your github project is set up to use `auto` :tada:

## Configuration

Getting started with `auto` is super easy.

1. Initialize Options (optional)
2. Configure Environment Variables
3. Create Labels
4. Run `auto`

### 1. Initialize Options <Label color="blue" className="ml-4">Optional</Label>

Initialize the bare minimum options and a few other optional things.
This will set you up locally but you will still have to configure environment variables in your CI.

```bash
auto init
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

You must configure some environment variables for publishing and releasing to work properly.

- `GH_TOKEN` - Used for publishing the GitHub release and creating labels ([create one here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)) (needs `repo` permission)

> Make sure you give the GH_TOKEN <Label color="blue">repo</Label> permission or `shipit` will fail!

#### Local `.env` <Label color="yellow" className="ml-4">Recommended</Label>

You can also store these values in a local file at the root of your project named `.env`.
You should make sure to add this file to your `.gitignore` so you don't commit any keys!
These env vars will override these any variable already set on the process.
This enables you to have a per project configuration that isn't effected by your global setup.

**`PROJECT_ROOT/.env`:**

```bash
GH_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
NPM_TOKEN=PUBLISH_TOKEN
```

#### HTTP Proxy

If you are running auto behind a `http` or `https` proxy, add either the `http_proxy` or `https_proxy` environment variable to your environment.
To test locally add it to `.env` file.
Remember this file is only local, so you will need to set the variable in your CI as well.

```bash
https_proxy=<PROXYHOST>:<PROXYPORT>
```

### 3. Create Labels

After that, you need to set up the labels on your GitHub project.
The types of labels that `auto` uses are:

- Versioning Labels - Used to calculate version numbers and make releases. To change them refer to [this](../configuration/autorc#labels).
- Changelog Labels - These labels do not effect the version calculation but they will change the section the PR displays in the changelog. These are customizable too, and you can even [add your own sections](../configuration/autorc#changelog-titles).

To create the labels for your project on GitHub, run the following command with your `GH_TOKEN`.

```bash
GH_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN auto create-labels
# or with .env file
auto create-labels
```

### 4. Run `auto`

`auto` is written so that each tool it exposes is useful in isolation.
You can use as much or as little of `auto` as you want!

There are two ways you can use `auto` to create releases.

1. `auto shipit` - Let `auto` do everything
2. Sub Commands - Run each command yourself

#### `auto shipit` <Label color="yellow" className="ml-4">Recommended</Label>

To version, changelog, publish and release your code all at the same time you should use the `shipit` command.
`shipit` runs all commands in the `auto` workflow and puts it into one meta-command.
It's context aware and will make different types of releases based on where you run it.

[Read more here.](../generated/shipit)

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "release": "auto shipit"
  }
}
```

#### Do-It-Yourself

All of the functionality of `shipit` is accessible through all of `auto`'s other commands.
Through these commands you can fit parts of `auto` into your existing release process.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "release": "./scripts/release.sh"
  }
}
```

Here is an example release script for a npm package:

```bash
export PATH=$(npm bin):$PATH

VERSION=`auto version`

## Support for label 'skip-release'
if [ ! -z "$VERSION" ]; then
  ## Update Changelog
  auto changelog

  ## Publish Package
  npm version $VERSION -m "Bump version to: %s [skip ci]"
  npm publish

  ## Create GitHub Release
  git push --follow-tags --set-upstream origin $branch
  auto release
fi
```

## Enterprise

If you are using enterprise github `auto` lets you configure the github API URL that it uses. You can configure this by using the CLI option `--github-api`, by setting the value in your [.autorc](../configuration/autorc#githubapi), or during `auto init`.
