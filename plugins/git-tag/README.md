# Git Tag Plugin

Manage your projects version through just a git tag.

If you're using this plugin you aren't releasing your code to any platform (npm, maven, etc). Instead you version calculations is done entirely though git tags.

This plugin only:

1. get lasts git
2. bump it to new version
3. create new tags
4. push to github
